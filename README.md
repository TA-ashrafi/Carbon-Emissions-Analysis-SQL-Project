## Dataset Overview

* **Source**: Cleaned CSV dataset based on Kaggle emissions data
* **Columns**:

  * `entity`: Name of country/region
  * `code`: Country code
  * `year`: Year of the record
  * `annual_emissions_tonnes`: CO₂ emissions in tonnes (annually)

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Database**: MySQL 8.0
* **Environment**: MySQL Workbench / CLI
* **Techniques Used**:

  * SQL Aggregations (SUM, AVG)
  * Window Functions (`LAG`)
  * Subqueries
  * Joins & Filtering
  * Data import using `LOAD DATA INFILE`

---

## Project Objectives

This project aims to:

* Analyze CO₂ emission trends globally and by country
* Identify top contributors and historical growth
* Derive year-on-year growth insights using window functions
* Practice structured querying and result interpretation

---

## SQL Tasks Performed

1. **Top Countries by Total CO₂ Emissions**
2. **Global Emissions Trends (Year-wise)**
3. **India's Annual Emissions Overview**
4. **Countries with Decreasing Emissions (2012–2017)**
5. **Average Annual Emissions by Country**
6. **First Year of Data Availability for Each Country**
7. **Record High CO₂ Emission Event**
8. **India's Emission Growth Rate (JOIN & LAG)**
9. **Emissions Comparison: 1990 vs 2020**
10. **Top 20 Countries by Total Emissions**

Each task is clearly documented with SQL code and output-ready structure.

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and open the SQL script (`emissions.sql`) in MySQL Workbench or CLI.
2. Import the dataset using `LOAD DATA INFILE` after enabling `secure_file_priv`.
3. Run each task block step-by-step.
4. Review query output and explore additional insights as needed.

---

## Suggested Visual Enhancements

* Use Power BI or Tableau for visual dashboards (optional).
* Visuals like heatmaps, trend lines, or country rankings can enrich understanding.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* SQL Aggregation, Joins, Subqueries
* Time Series Analysis
* Window Functions (LAG, LEAD)
* Clean query structuring
* Business logic-based analytics
